# GeometryGymIFC
C# classes to generate and parse OpenBIM IFC (Industry Foundation Class) files

These classes simultaneously support IFC2x3, IFC4 and Infrastructure extensions such as IFC4.3 and IFC4.4.
We provide early support for IFC extension projects and new versions.

Documentation on these classes is available on Building Smart websites, such as
[http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifc/IFC4/Add1/html/](https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4/ADD2_TC1/HTML/) (Browse Alphabetical Listings)
Documentation for other versions of IFC are available https://technical.buildingsmart.org/standards/ifc/ifc-schema-specifications/
 

Projects to demonstrate the classes include

Please contact me in advance of making significant changes to the core code, as 
it's possible existing code might be ported to the open source repository if I've
already implemented it.
